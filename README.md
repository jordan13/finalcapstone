#1. Initial Intentions
**Main goal was to create a website for my business, which I plan to launch this summer, that includes multiple pages displaying a portfolio and allowing people to schedule appointments and essentially create their dream website.
The website builder would allow you to create the frame work of your website and decide where you want certain items and what colors they should be.
The scheduler would allow you to set up an appointment during a specific date, location, and time. 
The contact page would allow you to email me directly with any questions.**

#1. continued (Reason for creating)
**I wanted to create a website for my business which I plan on starting soon.
Wanted to create something different from the conventional free lancer website
Allow user the option to envision their dream website before even meeting
Unique because this allows you to build the framework of your website, which you can then send to me. We can the meet and make it come to life**

#2. Methods used
**CSS
HTML
Javascript
PHP/PHP My Admin
Google
W3schools
Stack overflow
Professor Bae Tobin
Atom
**

# 2. continued, challenges faced
**The database to save the users for the contact page was very difficult to actually get working. The message saying that an email was sent would show and everything would work except the email actually being sent
The website builder feature with the squares changing colors; Overcome by constantly messing with the code and having Senior Tobin help me.
Currently trying to get the squares to show as independent colors and not all be the same color**

# 3. Final Product

**Essentially what my project does is that, there is an enter page and once you enter the site you are lead to my about me page
From there, we have a contact page and a scheduler where you can contact me regarding any questions and you can schedule meetings
The website builder is where you can bring the framework to life and get a general idea of how the website will be played out.**


#4. Future Work
**Getting the email from the contact page to actually send 
Make the boxes in the website builder to be different colors at once, not all change at the same time
Make the scheduler actually work **
